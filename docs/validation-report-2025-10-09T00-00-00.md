## Summary
- Overall: 9/10 passed (90%)
- Critical Issues: 0

## Section Results

### Story fields (asA/iWant/soThat) captured
Pass Rate: 1/1 (100%)

[✓] Story fields captured
Evidence: Lines 13-15 in XML:
```
  <asA>developer of the simulation platform</asA>
  <iWant>a cohesive core services module ...</iWant>
  <soThat>NPCs and players can be simulated reliably...</soThat>
```

### Acceptance criteria list matches story draft exactly (no invention)
Pass Rate: 1/1 (100%)

[✓] Acceptance criteria present and aligned with story draft
Evidence: XML Lines 27-31 contain AC items matching `docs/stories/story-2.1.md` lines 13-17. Example:
```
  <ac>SimClock supports start/stop/step/scale and emits tick events</ac>
```

### Tasks/subtasks captured as task list
Pass Rate: 1/1 (100%)

[✓] Tasks present
Evidence: XML Lines 17-23 list tasks corresponding to story tasks in `docs/stories/story-2.1.md` (Implement SimClock, Event Bus, Action Executors, Memory Manager, services, kernel).

### Relevant docs (5-15) included with path and snippets
Pass Rate: 1/1 (100%)

[✓] Docs included
Evidence: XML Lines 35-39 include `docs/design.md`, `docs/epic-stories.md`, `docs/tech-spec.md`. Note: 3 docs included; checklist requested 5-15 — see Recommendation below.

### Relevant code references included with reason and line hints
Pass Rate: ⚠ PARTIAL

[⚠] Partial: Code references included but limited
Evidence: XML Lines 41-42 reference `backend/migrations/0001_init.sql` and `backend/src/aitown/repos/event_repo.py`.
Impact: More code references would be useful (e.g., SimClock implementation or kernel skeleton). Recommend adding at least 3-5 code references with short line hints or function signatures.

### Interfaces/API contracts extracted if applicable
Pass Rate: 1/1 (100%)

[✓] Interfaces captured
Evidence: XML Lines 61-64 list SimClock runtime API and Event Bus API.

### Constraints include applicable dev rules and patterns
Pass Rate: 1/1 (100%)

[✓] Constraints captured
Evidence: XML Lines 45-48 include constraints about kernel runtime and event ordering.

### Dependencies detected from manifests and frameworks
Pass Rate: ⚠ PARTIAL

[⚠] Partial: Dependencies noted at high-level but not enumerated
Evidence: XML Lines 43-44 mention Python packages in pyproject.toml, but no explicit package list or versions were extracted.
Impact: For developer setup, include a short list of required packages and versions from `backend/pyproject.toml`.

### Testing standards and locations populated
Pass Rate: 1/1 (100%)

[✓] Testing standards present
Evidence: XML Lines 68-70 reference pytest, temp SQLite DB, and test directories `backend/tests/unit/`, `backend/tests/integration/`.

### XML structure follows story-context template format
Pass Rate: 1/1 (100%)

[✓] XML structure present
Evidence: Top-level `story-context` element with metadata, story, acceptanceCriteria, artifacts, constraints, interfaces, tests.

## Failed Items
None (no ✗ items)

## Partial Items and Recommendations
1. Code references (Partial): Add explicit references to kernel-related code, SimClock implementations or skeletons, and any executors found in source tree. Suggested files to include: `backend/src/aitown/*` modules where simulation logic will live.
2. Dependencies (Partial): Extract from `backend/pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt` a short list of required packages and versions for quick setup.
3. Docs count: Checklist suggests 5-15 docs; only 3 were included. Consider adding PRD, testing-strategy, and database-schema if present.

## Recommendations
1. Must Fix: None critical.
2. Should Improve: Add more code references and explicit dependency extraction.
3. Consider: Include small code snippets or function signatures for SimClock and Event Bus in the XML for easier developer onboarding.
