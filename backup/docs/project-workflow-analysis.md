# Project Workflow Analysis

**Date:** 2025-10-08
**Project:** aitown
**Analyst:** Egod

## Assessment Results

### Project Classification

- **Project Type:** Web application
- **Project Level:** Level 2 (assumed — 5-15 stories; you provided 10 stories; please confirm or change to Level 1)
- **Instruction Set:** prd (instructions-med)

### Scope Summary

- **Brief Description:** Focused web application scope covering ~10 stories across core user flows. (Please expand with a 1-2 line description of the product goal.)
- **Estimated Stories:** 10
- **Estimated Epics:** 1-2
- **Timeline:** TBD (please specify target dates or release milestone)

### Context

- **Greenfield/Brownfield:** TBD (please indicate if this is a new project or an addition to an existing codebase)
- **Existing Documentation:** docs/game-spec.md, docs/prd.md
- **Team Size:** TBD
- **Deployment Intent:** TBD (e.g., public SaaS, internal, staging-only initially)

## Recommended Workflow Path

### Primary Outputs

Focused PRD + Tech Spec, Epics & Story breakdown, Acceptance Criteria, Handoff notes for implementation and QA.

### Workflow Sequence

1. Assessment (this analysis)
2. PRD Workflow (instructions-med.md) — generate PRD.md and analysis sections
3. Tech-spec (tech-spec-template.md) — produce tech-spec.md for implementation
4. Epics & Stories (epics-template.md) — break down stories and acceptance criteria
5. UX/Design (if needed) — generate UX artifacts or pass to UX workflow
6. Handoff and validation

### Next Actions

1. Confirm/adjust Project Level (Level 2 suggested) and provide brief scope description.
2. Provide Timeline and Team Size.
3. Approve this analysis so I can invoke the PRD workflow and start generating the PRD and tech-spec artifacts (I will pass continuation context and existing documents).

## Special Considerations

- Existing `docs/prd.md` and `docs/game-spec.md` detected — PRD workflow will attempt to continue or merge where appropriate; confirm whether to continue or start fresh.
- Assumption: Level 2 chosen because 10 stories fall within 5-15; if you intended a minimal PRD only, change to Level 1.

## Technical Preferences Captured

- Communication language from module config: Chinese
- Output folder: {project-root}/docs
- Further technical preferences were not provided in this assessment; add any deployment/stack preferences (e.g., Node/Python, DB, auth) and I will record them here.
 - LLM configuration: For MVP, LLM and other critical system parameters are read from a startup configuration file (e.g., `config.yaml` or environment variables) when the service starts. Runtime administrator interfaces are not required for MVP; players cannot upload or register private OpenAI-compatible API credentials.

_This analysis serves as the routing decision for the adaptive PRD workflow and will be referenced by future orchestration workflows._
